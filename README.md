## Minesweeper
This project was carried out in Python as part of the first semester of our Computer Science DUT. Minesweeper is a game with no graphical interface.

## Presentation
Minesweeper is a classic game in which the player must find all the empty squares on the grid without exploding any mines. The grid is represented by a matrix, and each square contains either a mine or a number indicating the number of adjacent mines.

## Features
The Minesweeper game offers the following features:

Random generation of the grid with mines.
Display the grid with numbers and hidden mines.
Find empty squares using recursion.
Place flags to mark suspected mines.
Count down the time spent during the game.
Display the number of moves made.

## How to play the game
When you launch the game, you will be asked to choose the difficulty and size of the grid. Here are the options available:

Difficulty 1: The number of bombs is equal to the size of the grid.
Difficulty 2: The number of bombs is twice the size of the grid.
Difficulty 3: The number of bombs is equal to three times the size of the grid.
Once you've chosen the difficulty and grid size, you can start playing. The game will ask you if you want to uncover a square or place a flag. Use the "Enter" key to uncover a square and the "!" key to place a flag. Then enter the coordinates of the square you want to uncover or mark.

If you uncover a square containing a mine, the game ends and you lose. The number of moves you have made and the time taken will be displayed. Otherwise, continue to uncover the empty squares until you have uncovered all the squares without a mine to win the game.
